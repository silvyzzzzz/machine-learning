This repository contains the code and data for building a calorie burning prediction model using the [Calories Burning Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sparkyxt/calories-burning-dataset) from Kaggle. 
The process involves preprocessing the data, clustering based on certain variables, and then using the processed data to build a calorie prediction model.
